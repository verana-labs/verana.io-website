## Discover Verana: Reclaiming Your Digital World

Verana marks a radical departure from today’s platforms, where your content and connections are "rented" rather than "owned". We give individuals and organizations **true digital sovereignty**, empowering them to build **autonomous trust networks** and **self-sovereign verifiable services** that are automatically fairly **discoverable** based on **what they really provide**.
