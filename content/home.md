## Discover Verana: Reclaiming Your Digital World

Verana marks a radical departure from today‚Äôs platforms, where your content and connections are "rented" rather than "owned". We give individuals and organizations **true digital sovereignty**, empowering them to build **autonomous trust networks** and **self-sovereign verifiable services**.

## Ecosystems Use Verana to Build Their Own Trust Networks

Verana empowers **ecosystems**, from governments to industries, to establish **sovereign, verifiable trust networks** that they fully control.  
Each ecosystem leverages Verana as a **trust anchor** to define, enforce, and evolve their credential-based governance rules.

## Organizations and Individuals Use Verana to Build Decentralized Verifiable Services They Truly **Own**

With Verana, **anyone**, from global organizations to individual creators, can deploy their own **Verifiable Service (VS)**.  
Unlike centralized platforms, Verifiable Services are **self-sovereign**, meaning you fully control your data, identity, and audience relationships.

## Verifiable Service Controllers Register their Services in the Verifiable Service Directory

Anyone can register a **Verifiable Service** in the **Verifiable Service Directory**. Once registered, services are automatically crawled, their credentials dereferenced and verified, and then indexed in the **Verana Trust Resolver**. Think of it as the **yellow pages of verifiable data**, but cryptographically guaranteed.

## App Developers Create a New Class of Browsers: Verifiable User Agents

Verifiable User Agents (VUAs) are a new category of applications that **aggregate and interact with decentralized Verifiable Services (VSs)**. Instead of relying on centralized APIs or walled-garden platforms, these apps query the **Verana Trust Resolver**, making any compatible Verifiable Service instantly visible and usable.

## Verana is an Infrastructure, Not a Platform

Verana is **public digital infrastructure**, built to be open, decentralized, and free from vendor lock-in.  
It is not a subscription service or a platform you must depend on‚Äîit is technology anyone can run, extend, and govern.  

- üåç **Open and accessible**: free and open source, available for anyone to use.  
- üîó **Decentralized by design**: no single operator, no central point of control.  
- üõ°Ô∏è **Neutral and flexible**: works with any wallet, any credential format, any identity method.  
- ü§ù **Sovereign by default**: ecosystems, organizations, and individuals remain fully in control of their trust networks and data.  

With Verana, you don‚Äôt ‚Äúsign up‚Äù to a platform‚Äîyou **own the rails** of your digital trust infrastructure.
