## The No Ownership Problem

Today’s digital services are built on centralized platforms that act as gatekeepers. Whether it’s a social network, an app store, or a SaaS provider, organizations and individuals rarely own their services or their audiences:

- Content and connections are rented, not owned.
- Platforms enforce opaque rules and can de-platform users arbitrarily.
- Migrating services between providers is costly and disruptive.
- User data is captured, mined, and monetized by intermediaries.

The result: vendor lock-in, loss of sovereignty, and a fragile dependency on centralized operators.

## Migrating from Vendor Lock-in to Self Sovereign Services

Verana enables organizations and individuals to deploy Self-Sovereign Services: digital services they fully own and control. Built on verifiable credentials and decentralized trust registries, these services are portable, provable, and free from platform lock-in.

Key properties:

- True Ownership: services run under your decentralized identifier (DID), not under a platform account.
- Data Sovereignty: you retain full control over your data, audience, and connections.
- Portability: migrate freely between cloud, self-hosted, or hybrid environments without losing trust or discoverability.
- Verifiable Authenticity: cryptographically prove the legitimacy of your service to users and partners.
- Trust-Based Discovery: services are discoverable via Verana’s resolver, ranked by credentials—not ad budgets or opaque algorithms.

Examples of Self-Sovereign Services:

- Decentralized social channels owned entirely by creators.
- Agentic AI and IoT services operating under verifiable credentials.
- Content delivery channels (e.g., media catalogs) with guaranteed provenance.
- Customer support or business chatbots that are verifiable and portable.

This migration replaces dependency on centralized vendors with autonomous, verifiable ownership, turning digital services into assets you control, not permissions you rent.
