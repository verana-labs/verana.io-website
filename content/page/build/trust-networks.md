A digital trust **ecosystem** is an interconnected community of institutions and individuals who share an **ecosystem governance framework** (EGF) and use both technology and human rules to exchange verifiable data in a trustworthy way.

Verana is the **rail system** that **ecosystems** use to build and run their **trust networks**, enforcing the rules they define in their EGF.

### Ecosystem Example

In a given country, universities could form the **Utopia University Association** ecosystem. 

They create a governance framework that defines the purpose of the ecosystem, who can join as issuers (universities issuing diploma verifiable credentials), and who can join as verifiers (employers requesting diplomas).

In Verana, this governance is enforced by creating the ecosystem's trust registry, the diploma credential schema, and running validation processes for onboarding participants.

Once onboarded, **universities** can **issue verifiable diplomas**, and **employers** can request them directly from **graduates**, ensuring authenticity, integrity, and trust.

### Creation of an Ecosystem in Verana

Each ecosystem defines its autonomous governance through a modular trust architecture:

- 📜 Ecosystem Governance Framework (EGF): Defines the mission, rules, and policies that govern the ecosystem.
- 🗂️ Trust Registries: Maintain lists of schemas, authorized issuers, verifiers, and schema operators.
- 📑 Credential Schemas: Establish standardized formats for **verifiable credentials** (identity, training, licenses, etc.).
- 🧑‍⚖️ Onboarding & Delegation: Onboard issuers and verifiers directly - or delegate this task to trust registry operators.

### Who Can Build an Ecosystem?

Anyone can build an Ecosystem. It’s particularly suited for:

- 🏛️ Governments: Issue and verify digital IDs, business credentials, regulatory licenses.
- 🏥 Healthcare: Manage professional certifications, patient access, cross-border mobility.
- 📡 Telecommunications: Verify customer onboarding (KYC), issue proof of mobile phone number, proof of address.
- 🏦 Banks & Finance: Establish verified credit, KYC/AML compliance, and financial trust frameworks.
- 🎓 Education: Issue diplomas, professional training certificates, and lifelong learning credentials.
- 🏅 Certification & Testing Bodies: Issue and verify individual credentials, including language proficiency (B2/C1), trade skills (plumbers, electricians) and other professional certifications, and manage exam results and cross-border recognition.
- …and countless others.

### Privacy-Preserving Business Models

Verana empowers ecosystems to design and enforce **privacy-preserving business models** built on Verifiable Credentials. These models define **who pays, when, and how rewards are distributed** among participants, ensuring fairness and transparency without exposing sensitive data.

**Examples:**

- **Credential Holders** pay **issuers** to be verified and obtain a credential.  
- **Issuers** pay the **ecosystem owner** when issuing credentials.  
- **Verifiers** pay both the **issuer** and the **ecosystem owner** when requesting credential presentations from holders.  

Business models are **fully customizable**, enabling ecosystems to tailor incentives to their unique needs. A percentage of all fees is automatically distributed to **Verifiable User Agents (VUAs)**, ensuring wallets, apps, and browsers that power user adoption are rewarded too.
