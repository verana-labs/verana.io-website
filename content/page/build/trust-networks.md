## Ecosystems Use Verana to Build Their Own Trust Networks

Verana empowers ecosystems, from governments to industries, to establish sovereign, verifiable trust networks that they fully control. Each ecosystem leverages Verana as a trust anchor to define, enforce, and evolve their credential-based governance rules.

### How it Works

Each ecosystem defines its governance through a modular trust architecture:

- 📜 Ecosystem Governance Framework (EGF): Defines the mission, rules, and policies that govern the ecosystem.
- 🗂️ Trust Registries: Maintain lists of schemas, authorized issuers, verifiers, and schema operators.
- 📑 Credential Schemas: Establish standardized formats for **verifiable credentials** (identity, training, licenses, etc.).
- 🧑‍⚖️ Onboarding & Delegation: Onboard issuers and verifiers directly - or delegate this task to trust registry operators.

### Benefits for Ecosystems

With Verana, ecosystems move beyond centralized control to build **autonomous trust networks**. They gain the tools to self-govern, incentivize participants, and enforce trust at scale, while keeping data ownership and privacy in the hands of individuals and organizations.

### Who Can Build an Ecosystem?

Anyone can build an Ecosystem. It’s particularly suited for:

- 🏛️ Governments: Issue and verify digital IDs, business credentials, regulatory licenses.
- 🏥 Healthcare: Manage professional certifications, patient access, cross-border mobility.
- 📡 Telecommunications: Verify customer onboarding (KYC), issue proof of mobile phone number, proof of address.
- 🏦 Banks & Finance: Establish verified credit, KYC/AML compliance, and financial trust frameworks.
- 🎓 Education: Issue diplomas, professional training certificates, and lifelong learning credentials.
- 🏅 Certification & Testing Bodies: Issue and verify individual credentials, including language proficiency (B2/C1), trade skills (plumbers, electricians) and other professional certifications, and manage exam results and cross-border recognition.
- …and countless others.

### Privacy-Preserving Business Models

Verana empowers ecosystems to design and enforce **privacy-preserving business models** built on Verifiable Credentials. These models define **who pays, when, and how rewards are distributed** among participants, ensuring fairness and transparency without exposing sensitive data.

**Examples:**

- **Credential Holders** pay **issuers** to be verified and obtain a credential.  
- **Issuers** pay the **ecosystem owner** when issuing credentials.  
- **Verifiers** pay both the **issuer** and the **ecosystem owner** when requesting credential presentations from holders.  

Business models are **fully customizable**, enabling ecosystems to tailor incentives to their unique needs. A percentage of all fees is automatically distributed to **Verifiable User Agents (VUAs)**, ensuring wallets, apps, and browsers that power user adoption are rewarded too.
