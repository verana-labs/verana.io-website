## Privacy-Preserving Business Models

Verana empowers ecosystems to design and enforce **privacy-preserving business models** built on Verifiable Credentials. These models define **who pays, when, and how rewards are distributed** among participants, ensuring fairness and transparency without exposing sensitive data.

**Examples:**

- **Credential Holders** pay **issuers** to be verified and obtain a credential.  
- **Issuers** pay the **ecosystem owner** when issuing credentials.  
- **Verifiers** pay both the **issuer** and the **ecosystem owner** when requesting credential presentations from holders.  

Business models are **fully customizable**, enabling ecosystems to tailor incentives to their unique needs. A percentage of all fees is automatically distributed to **Verifiable User Agents (VUAs)**, ensuring wallets, apps, and browsers that power user adoption are rewarded too.
