### Create the Next Generation of Browsers: Verifiable User Agents

Verifiable User Agents (VUAs) are a new category of applications that aggregate and interact with decentralized Verifiable Services (VSs). Instead of relying on centralized APIs or walled-garden platforms, these apps query the Verana Trust Resolver, making any compatible Verifiable Service instantly visible and usable.

#### What VUAs Can Be

VUAs open the door to a wide variety of decentralized applications:

- 🌐 Decentralized Social Networks: E.g., an X-like network built from decentralized Social Channels.
- 🤖 Chatbot & AI Assistant Browsers: Apps for discovering and talking with official chat services and personal AI assistants.
- 🎬 Decentralized Video Apps: Streaming apps that aggregate film catalogs published by creators.
- 🛒 E-commerce Aggregators: Apps that list all businesses using e-commerce Verifiable Services.
- …and many more innovations waiting to be built.

#### Business Models for VUA Builders

VUA developers can also create their own Ecosystem within Verana. This allows them to:

- Define their Ecosystem Governance Framework (EGF).
- Issue or sell credentials to Verifiable Service owners.
- Control how services appear within their VUA app. When a service owner attaches such a credential to their Verifiable Service’s DID, they automatically become discoverable inside the VUA.

#### Why This Matters

Traditional apps depend on opaque algorithms and advertising-driven models. VUAs flip this model: visibility and ranking are based on verifiable credentials and ecosystem-defined governance, ensuring fairness, privacy, and transparency.
