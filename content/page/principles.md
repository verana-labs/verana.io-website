## Our Philosophy: Infrastructure, Not a Platform

Verana is public digital infrastructure, built to be open, decentralized, and free from vendor lock-in. It is not a subscription service or a platform you must depend on—it is technology anyone can run, extend, and govern.

- 🌍 Open and accessible: Free and open source, available for anyone to use.
- 🔗 Decentralized by design: No single operator, no central point of control.
- 🛡️ Neutral and flexible: Works with any wallet, any credential format, any identity method.
- 🤝 Sovereign by default: Ecosystems, organizations, and individuals remain fully in control of their trust networks and data.
With Verana, you don’t “sign up” to a platform—you own the rails of your digital trust infrastructure.
