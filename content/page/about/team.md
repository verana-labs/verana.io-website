## Chronology

Verana’s journey is rooted in solving the **three systemic problems of the internet** — **trust, ownership, and discovery**.  

- **2020 — Genesis**  
  • After many sessions at the **Internet Identity Workshop (IIW)**, Fabrice Rochette and Ariel Gentile invent the concept of **Verifiable Trust**.  
  • Publication of two foundational specs:  
    - [Verifiable Trust Specification](https://verana-labs.github.io/verifiable-trust-spec/)  
    - [Verifiable Public Registry Specification](https://verana-labs.github.io/verifiable-trust-vpr-spec/)  

- **2021–2022 — First Proofs of Concept**  
  • Development of the first **Verifiable User Agent**, the [Hologram Messaging App](https://hologram.zone).  
  • Creation of **Verifiable Service chatbots**, demonstrating that the Verifiable Trust model works in practice.  

- **2023 — Network Development**  
  • **Mathieu Gauthron** joins to lead the build of the first decentralized, blockchain-based Verifiable Public Registry (VPR) implementation.  

- **2024 — Verana Emerges**  
  • The project adopts its permanent name: **Verana**.  
  • Expansion of the ecosystem vision around **Verifiable Services** and **Trust Registries**.  

- **2025 — Testnet & Strategic Growth**  
  • **Philip A. Bildner** joins as **Strategic Advisor** to guide governance, fundraising, and partnerships.  
  • Launch of the [Verana Network Testnet](/page/testnet.md).
