## How Verana Is Governed

Verana’s governance is intentionally **split between two entities** with distinct but complementary roles:  

- **The Verana Council** ensures the **security, reliability, and neutrality** of the network by operating the validator infrastructure and making collective governance decisions.  
- **The Verana Foundation** drives **growth, innovation, and adoption** by supporting developers, funding ecosystem projects, and fostering community engagement.  

This dual structure ensures Verana is both **technically resilient** and **ecosystem-driven**, balancing operational stability with long-term growth and adoption.

## The Verana Council

Verana is run by a **Council**: a group of trusted, independent organizations from our industry. They don’t own Verana, but they **operate and oversee** the core servers (called “validators”) that keep the network secure and reliable.

> **Key idea:** Verana uses **Council governance with one-member-one-vote**. It is **not** stake-based or token-holder voting.

### Why a Council?

- **Trust you can verify:** Council members are known, accountable organizations.  
- **Stability over hype:** Changes require broad agreement, not whoever holds the most tokens.  
- **Industry alignment:** The people helping govern the network are active participants in our ecosystem.

### How decisions are made

- **One member, one vote:** Every Council member has a single vote.  
- **Supermajority required:** Most decisions need a **supermajority (e.g., two-thirds)** to pass.  
- **Transparent process:** Proposals and outcomes are recorded and published.

### Validators (the network nodes that secure Verana)

1. **Council Members = Validators**  
   Only Council members can run validator nodes (the secure servers that process transactions).

2. **3-Year Service Terms**  
   Validators commit to a **minimum three-year term** of reliable operation.

3. **Renewal Reviews**  
   At the end of a term, the Council reviews performance and votes on **renewal**.

4. **Adding or Removing Validators**  
   Bringing in a new validator—or offboarding one—**always requires a Council vote**.

5. **Emergency safety**  
   In urgent situations, the Council can **temporarily pause** a validator, followed by a formal vote.

### What this means for users and builders

- **Security:** Multiple independent operators keep the network resilient.  
- **Reliability:** Validators are long-term, vetted partners—no fly-by-night actors.  
- **Transparency:** Governance proposals and results are visible.  
- **Accountability:** Poor performance can lead to non-renewal or removal by a Council vote.

### What we *don’t* do

- **No stake-weighted governance:** Holding more tokens does **not** give you more votes.  
- **No single-party control:** No company or fund can unilaterally change the rules.

### Quick FAQ

**What’s a “validator”?**  
Independent, secure servers that check transactions and keep the network honest.

**Who is on the Council?**  
A rotating set of **industry organizations** selected for their track record, independence, and commitment to Verana’s mission.

**Can anyone become a validator?**  
Not directly. **Only Council members** can run validators, and Council membership requires a vote.

**How often do things change?**  
Validators serve **multi-year terms**. Changes happen through **proposals and supermajority votes**, not on a whim.

**Bottom line:** Verana’s Council model blends **professional stewardship** with **transparent, one-member-one-vote decisions**, so you get a network that’s trustworthy, stable, and built for the long term.

- **Ecosystem health:** Nurtures projects that expand the network’s value.  
- **Neutral support:** Acts in the interest of all participants, not just one group.
