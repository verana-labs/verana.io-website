## Our Philosophy: Infrastructure, Not a Platform

Verana is **public digital infrastructure** for trust online. Think of it like the **roads, power grid, or the internet itself**: open, shared, and not controlled by a single company.  

Unlike platforms you must subscribe to, Verana is technology that **any organization can operate, extend, and govern**. It’s not a service you rent; **it’s infrastructure you own.**

- 🌍 **Open and accessible**: Free and open source, available for anyone to use.
- 🔗 **Decentralized by design**: No single operator, no central point of control.
- 📐 **Built on Open Standards**: Interoperable by design, ensuring long-term stability and compatibility.
- 🛡️ **Neutral and flexible**: Works with any system, tool, or standard.
- 🤝 **Sovereign by default**: Organizations, industries, and governments remain fully in control of their **trust networks** and **data**.

With Verana, you don’t “sign up” to a platform—you **own the rails of digital trust** your ecosystem runs on.
