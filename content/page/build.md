Verana is **public digital infrastructure** for trust online. Think of it like the **roads, power grid, or the internet itself**: open, shared, and not controlled by a single company.  

Unlike platforms you must subscribe to, Verana is technology that **any organization can operate, extend, and govern**. It’s not a service you rent; **it’s infrastructure you own.**

- 🌍 **Open and accessible**: Free and open source, available for anyone to use.
- 🔗 **Decentralized by design**: No single operator, no central point of control.
- 📐 **Built on Open Standards**: Interoperable by design, ensuring long-term stability and compatibility.
- 🛡️ **Neutral and flexible**: Works with any system, tool, or standard.
- 🤝 **Sovereign by default**: Organizations, industries, and governments remain fully in control of their **trust networks** and **data**.

With Verana, you don’t “sign up” to a platform, you **own the rails of digital trust** your ecosystem runs on.

## What can we built with Verana?

### Trust Networks

Ecosystems - like governments, industries, or associations - can use Verana to create **trust networks** where rules are enforced by verifiable data instead of central gatekeepers. This allows them to issue credentials, define governance, and enable participants to interact with confidence and transparency.

### Discoverable Self Sovereign Verifiable Services

Organizations and individuals can launch their own **Verifiable Services**: digital services they fully own and control, and are automatically **indexed and discoverable**. From AI agents to social channels to e-commerce, these services are portable, provable, and free from the risk of deplatforming or lock-in.

### Verifiable User Agents

**Verifiable User Agents** are new apps and browsers that connect people to Verifiable Services and trust networks. They make discovery, interaction, and transactions seamless, powered by credentials and open standards, not ads or opaque algorithms.
