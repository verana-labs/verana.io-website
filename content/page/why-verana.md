## Trust

The internet was never built with a built-in way to **prove who or what you are talking to**.  

- Websites, apps, and people interact without cryptographic proof.  
- This makes it easy for impostors and fake accounts to spread fraud, scams, and misinformation.  
- Platforms (search engines, social networks, marketplaces) decide what you see. Their rankings and feeds are opaque and often pay-to-play.  
- Users can’t easily verify the authenticity of content, services, or accounts.  

In short: **we don’t know who to trust online.**

## Ownership

Most online services today are controlled by centralized platforms:  

- You don’t really own your service or your audience: you just rent space.
- Platforms make the rules and can shut you down anytime.
- Moving your service elsewhere is painful and risky.
- Platforms exploit user data for their own profit.

This creates **vendor lock-in** and a fragile dependence on big platforms.

## Discovery

Today, discoverability (being found by users) is controlled by a few giant platforms that sell ads or manipulate rankings.  

- Wealth is concentrated in those companies.  
- Small businesses and startups can’t compete with big ad budgets.  
- Consumers end up paying more, because advertising costs are baked into prices.  

This **hurts innovation** and makes things **more expensive for consumers**, since they end up paying for the ads.
