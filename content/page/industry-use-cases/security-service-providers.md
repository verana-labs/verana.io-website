## The Problem: Unverified Security Personnel  

### Hiring of new workers

Security Service Providers (SSPs) are entrusted with protecting businesses, communities, and critical infrastructure. Yet, today their workforce onboarding and verification processes are:

	â€¢	Manual & paper-based â€” IDs, background checks, and training proofs are siloed in company databases.
	â€¢	Non-portable â€” when guards move between providers, verification must be repeated.
	â€¢	Hard to audit â€” residents, police, or regulators cannot instantly verify a guardâ€™s legitimacy.
	â€¢	Fraud-prone â€” fake IDs, expired licenses, or unauthorized guards can go undetected.

This leads to weaker public safety, reputational risks, and unnecessary administrative costs.


### Onsite

When a security guard arrives onsite, there is **no reliable, real-time way** to verify that they are legitimate.  

- **Identity uncertainty**: There is no proof that the guard is the person they claim to be. Fake or borrowed IDs can go undetected.  
- **Authorization gap**: Site managers, residents, or clients cannot confirm whether this guard is **actually assigned and authorized** to work at this location.  
- **Employment status risk**: If a guard has been fired, suspended, or their license revoked, there is often no way for stakeholders onsite to know immediately.  

These weaknesses mean that unverified, unauthorized, or even dismissed guards can still show up and access sensitive sites.  

The result is a system vulnerable to **fraud, insider threats, and public safety risks**, while also increasing liability for Security Service Providers and their clients.  

## The Solution  

Verana enables the creation of a **Security Workforce Ecosystem Trust Registry** to issue, verify, and revoke guard credentials.  

### Create an Ecosystem Trust Registry  

- Define a **Security Guard Credential Schema** including:  
  - Identity (name, birthdate, photo)  
  - Employer (Security Service Provider)  
  - Granted site of work  
  - Validity period & revocation conditions  

- Publish an **Ecosystem Governance Framework (EGF)** that sets the rules for issuance, verification, and revocation.  

### Approve Issuers and Verifiers  

- **Issuers**: Accredited Security Service Providers, authorized by the ecosystem, can issue credentials to guards.


- **Verifiers**: Police, regulators, client businesses, residents, buildings, or even colleagues can request and instantly verify a guardâ€™s credential.  

## Guard Background Check  

Security Service Provider verifies the guard during hiring (identity, background check, training).

## Guard Credential Issuance

The provider, as an authorized issuer, issues a **Guard Credential** to the guardâ€™s **Digital Wallet (Verifiable User Agent)**.

## Guard in the Field  

- When arriving at a site, the guard presents their credential to prove they are authorized to be there.  
- Police officers, residents, or clients can request a **presentation** and instantly verify legitimacy.  
- Privacy-preserving selective disclosure can limit unnecessary personal data exposure.  

## Credential Revocation  

- If a guard leaves the company, the Security Service Provider **revokes the credential**.  
- Verifiers automatically detect revoked credentials, preventing misuse.  

## Benefits  

- **Security**: Guards can only operate if their credential is active and valid.  
- **Transparency**: Anyone (police, clients, residents) can verify instantly.  
- **Efficiency**: Onboarding streamlined, cross-provider mobility enabled.  
- **Trust**: Ecosystem-level governance ensures only verified guards serve in the field.
