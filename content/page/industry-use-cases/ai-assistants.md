  title: "The Problem: Unverifiable AI Services"
  intro: |
    AI assistants are rapidly becoming part of everyday life—from customer service bots to enterprise copilots. But most assistants today operate inside a **trust and accountability gap**.

      icon_color_class: "text-red-400"
      title: No Clear Ownership
      text: It's difficult to prove who controls an AI assistant; anyone can spin up a chatbot and impersonate a person, brand, or organization.
