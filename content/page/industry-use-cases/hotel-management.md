  title: "The Problem: Hotel Discovery & Broker Domination"
  intro: |
    The hotel industry is a striking example of how centralization locks value. Today, nearly all hotel reservations happen through **brokering platforms** like **Booking.com**, **Expedia**, **Agoda**, or **Airbnb**. These intermediaries capture a huge share of hotel revenues and quietly raise room costs for travelers.

    title: The Paradox
    text: |
      While users believe they're saving money, they actually pay more, since hotels must increase their prices to cover broker fees.
