Verana provides governments with full **open source software and infrastructure** to issue **privacy-preserving, verifiable, decentralized Digital IDs** that empower citizens while maintaining national sovereignty over identity systems.

## Create the Digital Identity Ecosystem

Governments:

- Establish an **Ecosystem Governance Framework (EGF)** that sets rules for the Citizen ID issuance, verification, and authorization of participants, including pay-per-verification business model if the desire.

- Create an **Ecosystem Trust Registry** in Verana to match the EGF, including the **Citizen ID Credential Schema**.

- Start onboarding ecosystem participants, as explained in the EGF, using Verana's trust registry onboarding process. Participants can be verifiers, or trust registry operators, if the want to delegate the onbaording of verifiers to one or more entities.

## Build a Digital Wallet

Governments build a **Digital Wallet mobile app** that acts as a **Verifiable User Agent (VUA)**.

- Citizens use the wallet to **store their Citizen ID Verifiable Credential (VC)**.
- The wallet is **self-sovereign**: citizens own their credentials, with no central account or dependency.
- Compatible with open standards like **EIDAS2, DIDs, DIDComm, W3C VCs, OpenID4VC, OpenID4VP**.

## Citizen Onboarding into the Central Database of the Registry

At public offices (e.g., civil registry):

1. Citizen biometric data is captured and documents validated.
2. Citizen data is recorded in the **central registry database**.
3. Citizen receives an **NFC-enabled ID card** containing personal and biometric information.

This ensures **official enrollment** into the state identity system.

## Issuing the Citizen ID Verifiable Credential

{{< img url="/images/iuc/gov-id-vc.png" floating="none" border="1px solid #DDDDDD" maxWidth="500px" >}}

Citizens obtain their **Citizen ID Verifiable Credential** by downloading the Government Digital Wallet and completing a secure identity validation process.  

### Example Enrollment Flow

1. The citizen captures a photo of their **physical ID card**. The app reads the **MRZ** to retrieve the key required for NFC access.  
2. The citizen enters the **PIN code of the card** to authorize the process.  
3. The citizen taps the ID card on the handset, enabling an **NFC read** of the document to extract personal and biometric information.  
4. The app performs a **live face match** against the extracted ID photo to confirm that the handset user is the legitimate cardholder.  
5. If all checks succeed, a **Citizen ID Verifiable Credential** is securely issued to the citizen‚Äôs digital wallet.  

üëâ Any previously issued credential is **automatically revoked**, guaranteeing that only **one valid credential** exists per citizen at any time.  

## Authorized Verifiers

The government decides who can request credential presentations:

- Applicants (e.g., banks, telecoms, hospitals) undergo a **validation process** before being authorized.
- Once approved, they are registered as **authorized verifiers** for the Citizen ID schema.
- Governments can implement a **pay-per-verification** model:
- Each verification request incurs a fee.
- Fee payment is **privacy-preserving**, issuers of a Citizen ID credential cannot know, even if they receive a payment for a presentation request, who is the citizen that presented the credential to a verifier (bank,...).

## Selective Disclosure

By supporting advanced credential formats (e.g., ZKPs, BBS+, Anoncreds), governments can enable:

- Citizens to **prove attributes without revealing full data** (e.g., ‚Äúover 18‚Äù without disclosing date of birth).
- Minimal disclosure principles, reducing risks of data misuse.
