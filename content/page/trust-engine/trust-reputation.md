## Trust Reputation

Trust Reputation transforms on-chain activity into a **transparent and verifiable measure of credibility**. It is built on factors such as:  

- Start date of participation in Verana.  
- Size of the participantâ€™s Trust Deposit.  
- Ecosystems they actively contribute to.  
- Number of credentials issued and/or verified.  
- Governance history, including slashes.  

Trust Reputation is **publicly accessible** and visible across Verifiable User Agents (VUAs). It can be verified by services, apps, and even AI agents, enabling peers to decide who they trust before engaging.  

A **Hall-of-Fame dashboard** highlights leading participants and their deposits, making the reputation economy not only verifiable but also transparent and rewarding.
