## Trust Deposit

A portion of trust fees collected in business models is allocated to **Trust Deposits** for both payers and payees.  

A **Trust Deposit** acts as a **stake** that grows with participant activity across ecosystems. It reflects engagement, integrity, and contribution to ecosystems, serving as a foundation for decentralized accountability.  

**Key Purposes of Trust Deposits**

| **Purpose**            | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stake & Incentives** | Grows with activity; rewards engagement with yield and higher reputation.        |
| **Enforcement**        | Ecosystems can slash deposits for rule violations; slashed deposits must be replenished to continue participation. |
| **Skin in the Game**   | Ensures participants commit seriously, discouraging fraud and low-effort actions.|
| **Non-Custodial**      | Held fully on-chain, beyond the control of any centralized authority.            |

This mechanism makes governance **self-enforcing**, combining **incentives** with **accountability** in a decentralized way.
