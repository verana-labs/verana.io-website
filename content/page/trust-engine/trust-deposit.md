  title: Trust Deposit
  description: |
    A **Trust Deposit** is a stake within the Verana Network that grows automatically as participants interact with ecosystems. Each participant maintains their own deposit, reflecting verifiable activity and contribution to the trust networks they engage with.

      title: Validation Process
      body: |
        When a validation process is executed, the **trust deposits of both the applicant and the validator** increase, rewarding participation in the verification ecosystem.

      title: Credential Issuance & Verification
      body: |
        If the ecosystem enables **pay-per-issuance** and/or **pay-per-verification**, the trust deposits of all participants in the permission tree grow each time a credential is issued or verified.
      note: |
        Additionally, the trust deposits of involved user agents and wallet user agents increment with each verified credential.

      title: Service Directory Participation
      body: |
        Registering or renewing a DID in the **service directory** increases the trust deposit of the participant who executes the transaction, encouraging active ecosystem participation.

    icon_color_class: "text-verana"
    title: Percentage-Based Deduction System
    body: |
      The **trust deposit** operates as a **percentage-based deduction** applied to circulating trust fees. These deductions accumulate in individual deposits, reflecting ongoing participation and service provision.

          value: "100 VNA"
    note: |
      **Note:** The percentage allocated to trust deposits (e.g., 20%) is configurable and defined by the **VPR governance authority**, ensuring ecosystem-specific control over incentive structures.
core_purposes:
  title: Core Purposes
  intro: |
    The **trust deposit** mechanism ensures that participants **adhere to the ecosystem governance framework (EGF)**, combining incentives with enforcement to maintain decentralized accountability.

  intro:
    title: Governance Framework Rules
    body: |
      Each ecosystem defines, in its **ecosystem governance framework (EGF)**, the rules participants must follow. The EGF also specifies the conditions under which a **slash**—a penalty applied to a participant’s trust deposit—may occur.
