## The Verifiable Service Directory and the Trust Resolver

Anyone can register a **Verifiable Service** in the **Verifiable Service Directory**. Once registered, services are automatically crawled, their credentials dereferenced and verified, and then indexed in the **Verana Trust Resolver**. Think of it as the **yellow pages of verifiable data**, but cryptographically guaranteed.

With this index in place, users, services, and apps can perform **advanced trust-based queries**, such as:

- 🔍 *Where is Alice’s AI Assistant whose attached **AI Assistant Credential** shows the owner name “Alice”?*  
- 🌐 *Which social channels hold a **Blue Network Credential** from **Ecosystem DEF** and have an avatar credential containing **@bob_influencer**?*  
- 🛍️ *Which services in Bristol, UK present an **E-commerce Credential** from issuers of the **Ecosystem Ecommerce Global Alliance** and sell **baby shoes**?*  
- 🏨 *List all services with a valid **Hotel Credential** from **Ecosystem PMS Vendor ABC** located in **France**.*  
- 🔧 *Show certified plumbers who hold a **Plumber Credential** from **Ecosystem Verified Workers** in **Bogotá**.*  

The **Trust Resolver** ensures search results are based solely on **verifiable data** contained in verifiable credentials, not arbitrary or opaque ranking algorithms.  

This fundamentally **disrupts today’s economy** of advertising-driven visibility (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, etc.) and replaces it with a **decentralized economy of trust**, where:  

- ✅ Ecosystems certify claims and issue credentials.  
- ✅ Results are transparent and verifiable.  
- ✅ Businesses and individuals compete on **trust and authenticity**, not ad budgets.  

The result is a **public, verifiable database of claims**, open and searchable by anyone, that shifts value from centralized intermediaries to decentralized ecosystems.
