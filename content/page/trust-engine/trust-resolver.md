intro:
  paragraphs:
    - |
      The internet today is built on **implicit trust**: users rely on search engines, platforms, and intermediaries to decide what is visible and who can be trusted. This model is opaque, advertising-driven, and often unsafe.
    - |
      The **Verana Trust Resolver** offers a new approach: a **public, decentralized index of verifiable services**. Instead of paid rankings or hidden algorithms, discoverability is based solely on **cryptographically verified credentials** issued by trusted ecosystems.

    title: In Short
    text: |
      The Trust Resolver is the **search engine of verifiable trust**, open, transparent, and free from centralized control.
how_it_works:
  title: How It Works
  lead: |
    Anyone can register a **Verifiable Service** in the **Verifiable Service Directory**. Once registered, services are automatically crawled, their credentials dereferenced and verified, and then indexed in the **Verana Trust Resolver**.
  note: |
    Think of it as the **yellow pages of verifiable data**, but cryptographically guaranteed.

  title: Disrupting the Attention Economy
  lead_paragraphs:
    - |
      The **Trust Resolver** ensures search results are based solely on **verifiable data** contained in verifiable credentials, not arbitrary or opaque ranking algorithms.
    - |
      This fundamentally **disrupts today's economy** of advertising-driven visibility (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, etc.) and replaces it with a **decentralized economy of trust**.
