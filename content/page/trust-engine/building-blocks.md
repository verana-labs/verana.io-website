    - "We want **portable, verifiable trust** between parties that don't share a database or a single identity provider. The Web's default identifier (the URL) ties trust to DNS, certificate authorities, and domain control—great for content addressing, fragile for **entity** addressing (people, orgs, services, agents)."
    - "We need identifiers that are **cryptographically bound to controllers**, interoperable across ecosystems, and work offline. We need a way to attach **verifiable claims** to those identifiers, prove them selectively, and check who's authorized to issue/verify them. That's what **DIDs + VCs + Trust Registries** provide."

  did_document:
    title: "1.1 DID Document (the metadata for a DID)"

  benefits_title: "Why DIDs > URLs for identifying entities:"
  benefits:
    - text: "**Self-certifying control:** Proof of control comes from possession of the private key corresponding to keys in the DID Document, not just control of a domain or account."
    - text: "**Key agility:** Rotate keys and add multiple keys/relations without changing the DID."
    - text: "**Transport agnostic:** Works online/offline and across transports (HTTP, DIDComm, Bluetooth, QR, NFC)."
    - text: "**Method choice:** Different **DID methods** offer different root-of-trust models (web, event logs, ledgers, etc.)."
