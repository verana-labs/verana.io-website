Verana
The Open Trust Layer for the Internet. Own your identity, your data, and your digital services.

Discover Verana: Reclaiming Your Digital World
Verana marks a radical departure from today’s platforms, where your content and connections are "rented" rather than "owned". We give individuals and organizations true digital sovereignty, empowering them to build autonomous trust networks and self-sovereign verifiable services.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Ecosystems Use Verana to Build Their Own Trust Networks
Verana empowers ecosystems, from governments to industries, to establish sovereign, verifiable trust networks that they fully control. Each ecosystem leverages Verana as a trust anchor to define, enforce, and evolve their credential-based governance rules.
How it Works: Our Modular Trust Architecture Each ecosystem defines its governance through a modular trust architecture:
• 📜 Ecosystem Governance Framework (EGF): Defines the mission, rules, and policies that govern the ecosystem.
• 🗂️ Trust Registries: Maintain lists of authorized issuers, verifiers, and schema operators.
• 📑 Credential Schemas: Establish standardized formats for verifiable credentials (identity, training, licenses, etc.).
• 🧑‍⚖️ Onboarding & Delegation: Onboard issuers and verifiers directly—or delegate this task to trust registry operators.
Benefits for Ecosystems With Verana, ecosystems move beyond centralized control to build autonomous trust networks. They gain the tools to self-govern, incentivize participants, and enforce trust at scale, while keeping data ownership and privacy in the hands of individuals and organizations.
Who Can Build an Ecosystem?
• 🏛️ Governments: Issue and verify digital IDs, business credentials, regulatory licenses.
• 🏥 Healthcare: Manage professional certifications, patient access, cross-border mobility.
• 📡 Telecommunications: Verify customer onboarding (KYC), issue proof of mobile phone number, proof of address.
• 🏦 Banks & Finance: Establish verified credit, KYC/AML compliance, and financial trust frameworks.
• 🎓 Education: Issue diplomas, professional training certificates, and lifelong learning credentials.
• …and countless others.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Organizations and Individuals: Truly Own Your Digital Services
With Verana, anyone, from global organizations to individual creators, can deploy their own Verifiable Service (VS). Unlike centralized platforms, Verifiable Services are self-sovereign, meaning you fully control your data, identity, and audience relationships.
Why Verifiable Services Matter Owning a Verifiable Service means:
• 🔐 Full Data Ownership: You control your data and connections.
• 🛡️ Privacy by Design: No intermediaries exploiting or mining user interactions.
• ✅ Proof of Authenticity: Prove ownership of your service to your audience.
• ✍️ Signed Content: Integrate with C2PA so all published content is cryptographically signed by your DID.
• 🏗️ Deployment Freedom: Host anywhere: cloud, self-hosted, or migrate freely at any time.
Examples of Verifiable Services
• 📢 Decentralized Social Channels: E.g., the official channel of an influencer who owns 100% of their reach.
• 🤖 Decentralized AI Agents: E.g., a personal AI assistant that runs under your DID and respects your privacy.
• 🔄 Agent-to-Agent Communication: E.g., two autonomous AI agents exchanging credentials to securely negotiating a contract.
• 💬 Decentralized Messaging & Chatbots: E.g., a customer support chatbot for a mobile operator, verifiable and portable.
• 🎬 Decentralized Content Delivery Channels: E.g., a film catalog directly published by a studio, with provenance guaranteed.
• …and many more innovations waiting to be built.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. App Developers: Create the Next Generation of Browsers (Verifiable User Agents)
Verifiable User Agents (VUAs) are a new category of applications that aggregate and interact with decentralized Verifiable Services (VSs). Instead of relying on centralized APIs or walled-garden platforms, these apps query the Verana Trust Resolver, making any compatible Verifiable Service instantly visible and usable.
What VUAs Can Be VUAs open the door to a wide variety of decentralized applications:
• 🌐 Decentralized Social Networks: E.g., an X-like network built from decentralized Social Channels.
• 🤖 Chatbot & AI Assistant Browsers: Apps for discovering and talking with official chat services and personal AI assistants.
• 🎬 Decentralized Video Apps: Streaming apps that aggregate film catalogs published by creators.
• 🛒 E-commerce Aggregators: Apps that list all businesses using e-commerce Verifiable Services.
• …and many more innovations waiting to be built.
Business Models for VUA Builders VUA developers can also create their own Ecosystem within Verana. This allows them to:
• Define their Ecosystem Governance Framework (EGF).
• Issue or sell credentials to Verifiable Service owners.
• Control how services appear within their VUA app. When a service owner attaches such a credential to their Verifiable Service’s DID, they automatically become discoverable inside the VUA.
Why This Matters Traditional apps depend on opaque algorithms and advertising-driven models. VUAs flip this model: visibility and ranking are based on verifiable credentials and ecosystem-defined governance, ensuring fairness, privacy, and transparency.

4. The Engine of Trust: How Verana Works
Verana is public digital infrastructure that guarantees trust and integrity through its fundamental mechanisms:
• Verifiable Service Directory & Trust Resolver This is the yellow pages of verifiable data, cryptographically guaranteed. It enables advanced trust-based queries, ensuring that search results are based solely on verifiable data contained in verifiable credentials, not arbitrary or opaque ranking algorithms. This fundamentally disrupts today’s economy of advertising-driven visibility and replaces it with a decentralized economy of trust, where businesses and individuals compete on trust and authenticity, not ad budgets. The result is a public, verifiable database of claims, open and searchable by anyone, that shifts value from centralized intermediaries to decentralized ecosystems.
• Privacy-Preserving Business Models Verana empowers ecosystems to design and enforce privacy-preserving business models built on Verifiable Credentials. These models define who pays, when, and how rewards are distributed among participants, ensuring fairness and transparency without exposing sensitive data. A percentage of all fees is automatically distributed to Verifiable User Agents (VUAs), ensuring wallets, apps, and browsers that power user adoption are rewarded too.
• Trust Deposit A Trust Deposit acts as a stake that grows with participant activity across ecosystems. It ensures participants commit seriously, discouraging fraud and low-effort actions. This mechanism makes governance self-enforcing, combining incentives with accountability in a decentralized way. Deposits are non-custodial and held fully on-chain.
• Trust Reputation Trust Reputation transforms on-chain activity into a transparent and verifiable measure of credibility. It is built on factors such as start date of participation, size of Trust Deposit, ecosystems contributed to, number of credentials, and governance history (including slashes). Publicly accessible and visible across Verifiable User Agents (VUAs), it enables peers to decide who they trust before engaging. A Hall-of-Fame dashboard highlights leading participants and their deposits, making the reputation economy not only verifiable but also transparent and rewarding.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Our Philosophy: Infrastructure, Not a Platform
Verana is public digital infrastructure, built to be open, decentralized, and free from vendor lock-in. It is not a subscription service or a platform you must depend on—it is technology anyone can run, extend, and govern.
• 🌍 Open and accessible: Free and open source, available for anyone to use.
• 🔗 Decentralized by design: No single operator, no central point of control.
• 🛡️ Neutral and flexible: Works with any wallet, any credential format, any identity method.
• 🤝 Sovereign by default: Ecosystems, organizations, and individuals remain fully in control of their trust networks and data.
With Verana, you don’t “sign up” to a platform—you own the rails of your digital trust infrastructure.
