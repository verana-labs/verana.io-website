**Verana**: a Trust Layer for the Internet  

> Verana solves three systemic problems holding back the Internet today: trust, ownership, and discovery. These are the pillars of our value proposition. The exact pitch may evolve, but this is the framework guiding how we think about the market opportunity.

## 1. Making the Internet Trustworthy  

### Problem  
The internet has no built-in way to prove identity or authenticity.  
- Fake accounts, scams, and misinformation spread easily.  
- Platforms like search and social decide what people see.  
- Users can’t be sure who runs a service or publishes content.  

### Solution  
Verana adds a **verifiable identity layer** with **verifiable credentials** (digital proofs).  
- Service owners get credentials from trusted issuers.  
- They attach them to their websites, apps, or content.  
- Users can check those credentials locally and know who to trust.

## 2. Service Ownership  

### Problem  
Today’s services depend on big platforms.  
- You don’t own your audience, the platform does.  
- Rules are opaque; you can be cut off anytime.  
- Moving away is hard and risky.  

### Solution  
With Verana you can build **Self-Sovereign Services**:  
- Run under your own decentralized ID (DID).  
- Own your data, audience, and connections.  
- Move freely between hosts without losing trust.  
- Services are authentic and discoverable based on proof, not ads.

## 3. Service Discovery  

### Problem  
Big ad platforms control visibility.  
- Only those with large budgets get seen.  
- Innovation suffers; consumers pay more.  

### Solution  
Verana enables **trust-based discovery**:  
- Ecosystems issue credentials proving claims.  
- Services attach credentials and are auto-indexed.  
- Users discover them based on verifiable data, not ad spend.

✨ **In short:** Verana makes the Internet trustworthy, gives real ownership of services, and ensures discovery is fair and based on truth—not money.
