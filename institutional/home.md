# Building the Verifiable Trust Layer of the Internet — as a Public Good

*Open standards. Public infrastructure. Privacy-first.*

Verana enables **services, ecosystems, and AI agents** to operate with **verifiable trust** — using **open, decentralized protocols** based on **Verifiable Credentials** and **public registries**.

## Today’s Internet runs on implicit trust

> small section with an illustration, no blocks, in muted, dark tone.

Today's digital world suffers from centralized trust, unverifiable AI agents, poor service transparency, broken privacy, and business models that prioritize surveillance over trust.

**Verana changes this** → we provide the specifications and public infrastructure to shift the Internet to the **“don’t trust, verify” principle.**

## We believe in verifiable trust

> bigger section, in brighter tone, blocks with icon or illustration + title. When hover, show a description (to be written). Similar to accenture blocks (those without a slider)

- **Proof-of-Trust** for any service or agent  
- **Re-decentralization** → services run on **protocol**, not platform lock-in  
- **Public verifiable trust registries** 
- **Fair Privacy-preserving business models** that rewards all participants
- **Native kid protection** without the need of sharing sensitive data
- **Computed reputation & governance enforcement** trust deposit, slash, etc

## Why Now?

> no clickable bloc, only text and icon / illustrations

- **AI agents are everywhere** — but unverifiable.  
- **Decentralized identity is maturing** — but lacks incentives.  
- **Users demand privacy** — but services rely on surveillance.  
- **Trust needs to be built into the fabric of the Internet** — not added as an afterthought.  

**Verana makes this possible — today.**
