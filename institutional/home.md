# Building a Verifiable, Decentralized Trust Layer for the Internet

*Open standards. Public infrastructure. Privacy-first.*

Verana enables **services, ecosystems, and AI agents** to operate with **verifiable trust** — using **open, decentralized protocols** based on **Verifiable Credentials** and **public registries**.

---

## Today’s Internet runs on implicit trust

### We believe in verifiable trust

- Centralized platforms decide who is trusted.  
- AI agents lack verified identity.  
- Users cannot easily verify services.  
- Privacy is routinely compromised.  
- Business models reward surveillance—not trust.  

**Verana changes this** → we provide the specifications and public infrastructure to shift the Internet to **“don’t trust, verify.”**

## How Verana Works

**Verana provides:**

- ✅ **Verifiable Trust Specification** → defines how services present verifiable credentials  
- ✅ **Verifiable Public Registry Specification** → defines how ecosystems govern trust  
- ✅ **The Verana Verifiable Trust Network** → an open, community-operated network to support trust enforcement  

**Key features:**

- **Proof-of-Trust** for any service or agent  
- **Re-decentralization** → services run on **protocol**, not platform lock-in  
- **Public verifiable trust registries**

## 🛡️ A Public Good — Not a Platform

The **Verana Verifiable Trust Network (VVTR)** is **free to use** and **open to all**.  

It is designed as **public digital infrastructure** — to serve ecosystems, services, and users alike — with:

✅ **No licensing fees**  
✅ **No lock-in**  
✅ **Decentralized governance**  
✅ **Built on open standards**  

**Trust should be a public good — not a platform business.**  

With Verana, it is.

## Why Now?

- **AI agents are everywhere** — but unverifiable.  
- **Decentralized identity is maturing** — but lacks incentives.  
- **Users demand privacy** — but services rely on surveillance.  
- **Trust needs to be built into the fabric of the Internet** — not added as an afterthought.  

**Verana makes this possible — today.**
