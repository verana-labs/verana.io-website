## Why we need a Verifiable Trust Network

- For all the reasons explained in [Why we need Verifiable Trust](/page/learn-vt-why);
- To provide monetization solutions to existing Ecosystems that use Verifiable Credentials - see [Business Models](/page/learn-vt-business-models);
- To allow anyone to create its Ecosystem and build its [Verifiable Reputation](/page/learn-vt-trust-deposit-and-reputation);
- To provide an unbiased Service [Directory and search engine](/page/learn-vt-service-directory), where returned results rely on verifiable data.
- To enable new kinds of self-hosted decentralized services.

## The Verana Verifiable Trust Network

Thanks to its founder members, since 2024, the Verana Foundation is working on an open-source implementation of a Cosmos-SDK based Verifiable Public Registry (VPR): [verana-blockchain](https://github.com/verana-labs/verana-blockchain).

- The [verana-blockchain](https://github.com/verana-labs/verana-blockchain) implementation is based on the v1 of the [VPR spec](https://github.com/verana-labs/verifiable-trust-vpr-spec).

Other related repositories are under active development, such as:

- The [verana-frontend](https://github.com/verana-labs/verana-frontend): a container-based open source frontend for Ecosystems, to manage Trust Registries, Credential Schemas, permissions, etc

- [verre](https://github.com/verana-labs/verre): a typescript library for resolving trust, as specified in the [Verifiable Trust spec](https://github.com/verana-labs/verifiable-trust-spec).

Website of the **Verana Verifiable Trust Network** will be https://verana.io and will be delivered in Q2/2025, when **testnet** launches.

## Essential Credential Schemas in the Verana Verifiable Trust Network

In the **Verana Verifiable Trust Network**, the **Verana Foundation** will:

- Operate a **Trust Registry** to define and manage ECSs
- Govern those ECSs through a transparent **Ecosystem Governance Framework**
- Select and validate global **Issuers** for each ECS
- Anchor each ECS as a verifiable credential (JSON Schema Credential) issued by the registry's DID

By doing so, Verana provides the trust anchor needed for decentralized applications and ecosystems to interoperate safely and confidently.

## Call to existing ecosystems, foundations and the identity industry

The Verana Foundation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the development and governance of open, decentralized trust infrastructure.

As the **Verana Verifiable Trust Network** is designed as a **public good**, its mainnet launch will include the introduction of the **VNA token**, which powers trust-related fees and operations across the network. In alignment with the Foundation’s mission of decentralization and transparency, the VNA token’s total supply will be **fairly distributed** among all contributors who have meaningfully supported the project and demonstrated alignment with its values.

To ensure a decentralized and community-driven network from day one, token distribution at launch will include a broad range of stakeholders. Eligible contributors (unordered) may include:

- Members of the Verana Foundation  
- Contributors to GitHub repositories  
- Governance advocates and working group participants  
- Legal and compliance advisors  
- Builders integrating the Verifiable Trust layer into wallets, IDPs, or ecosystem services  
- Verana Foundation Ambassadors  
- **Network Validators** (entities running validator nodes for the Verana Verifiable Trust Network)  
- Verifiable Credential experts and early adopters  
- **Essential Credential Schema (ECS) Issuers**  
- Community managers and moderators  
- Early-stage ecosystem partners and aligned VCs

**Token distribution amounts and vesting periods** will depend on factors such as the contributor’s start date, type and level of involvement, and other criteria currently being finalized. The Verana Foundation is committed to transparency and will keep the community informed as token allocation guidelines and governance processes evolve.

## Mainnet launch

The launch of the **Verana Verifiable Trust Network**, the first public, decentralized and verifiable trust network, is currently scheduled for **Q1/2026**.
