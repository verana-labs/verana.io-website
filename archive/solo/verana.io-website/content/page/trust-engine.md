Verana is public digital infrastructure that guarantees trust and integrity through its fundamental mechanisms:

## Verifiable Service Directory & Trust Resolver

 This is the yellow pages of verifiable data, cryptographically guaranteed. It enables advanced trust-based queries, ensuring that search results are based solely on verifiable data contained in verifiable credentials, not arbitrary or opaque ranking algorithms. This fundamentally disrupts todayâ€™s economy of advertising-driven visibility and replaces it with a decentralized economy of trust, where businesses and individuals compete on trust and authenticity, not ad budgets. The result is a public, verifiable database of claims, open and searchable by anyone, that shifts value from centralized intermediaries to decentralized ecosystems.

## Privacy-Preserving Business Models

Verana empowers ecosystems to design and enforce privacy-preserving business models built on Verifiable Credentials. These models define who pays, when, and how rewards are distributed among participants, ensuring fairness and transparency without exposing sensitive data. A percentage of all fees is automatically distributed to Verifiable User Agents (VUAs), ensuring wallets, apps, and browsers that power user adoption are rewarded too.

## Trust Deposit

A Trust Deposit acts as a stake that grows with participant activity across ecosystems. It ensures participants commit seriously, discouraging fraud and low-effort actions. This mechanism makes governance self-enforcing, combining incentives with accountability in a decentralized way. Deposits are non-custodial and held fully on-chain.

## Trust Reputation

Trust Reputation transforms on-chain activity into a transparent and verifiable measure of credibility. It is built on factors such as start date of participation, size of Trust Deposit, ecosystems contributed to, number of credentials, and governance history (including slashes). Publicly accessible and visible across Verifiable User Agents (VUAs), it enables peers to decide who they trust before engaging. A Hall-of-Fame dashboard highlights leading participants and their deposits, making the reputation economy not only verifiable but also transparent and rewarding.
