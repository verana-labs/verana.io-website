### What Is Verana?

Verana is a decentralized trust infrastructure for verifiable credentials, governance, and credential-based ecosystem monetization.

#### 🌱 1. For a Newbie User: What Can *You* Expect from Verana?

- **Control your data** — Manage your verifiable credentials in your own wallet or app, with no central authority.
- **Know who you're dealing with** — Services must prove who they are before you connect.
- **Safer interactions** — Avoid scams and impersonation via Verana’s verifiable trust framework.
- **Protect your privacy** — Share only what’s needed, on your terms, with full transparency on who’s requesting it.

#### 🌐 2. Ecosystems: What Can an Ecosystem Expect from Verana?

- **Define your own trust rules** — Create a custom governance framework tailored to your community or industry.
- **Select your own issuers/verifiers** — Decide who can issue or verify credentials in your domain, and enforce it verifiably.
- **Privacy-preserving monetization** — Introduce pay-per-issuance or pay-per-verification models without sacrificing user privacy.
- **Enforce accountability** — Use trust deposits and slashing to ensure compliance.
- **Interoperability** — Connect with other decentralized ecosystems without giving up control.

Examples:

- create your Ecosystem and build a driving license verifiable credential for your country, select who can issue the credential and verify it. Choose business models.
- join an existing ecosystem: be an issuer of an Organization credential in your country

- **Join ecosystems** — Apply for roles like issuer or verifier in relevant credential schemas, through a transparent process.
- **make your content verifiable with C2PA** - sign content and make it resolvable

Examples:
